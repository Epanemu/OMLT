OMLT
========

OMLT is a Python package for representing machine learning models (neural networks and gradient-boosted trees) within the Pyomo optimization environment. The package provides various optimization formulations for machine learning models (such as full-space, reduced-space, and MILP) as well as an interface to import sequential Keras and general ONNX models.
