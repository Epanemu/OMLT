    "# ML Surrogates for Chemical Processes with OMLT\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of TensorFlow Keras and OMLT to produce an ML surrogate based on data from a chemical process flowsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons to build surrogate models for complex processes, even when higher fidelity models already exist (e.g., reduce model size, improve convergence reliability, replace models with externally compiled code and make them fully-equation oriented).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have an existing model for an auto-thermal reformer flowsheet that has been built using the IDAES-PSE package. IDAES-PSE is a Python package that is built on Pyomo and provides a framework for equation-oriented modeling and analysis of advanced energy systems. We use this package to generate data for our systems, and then we utilize this data in an optimization problem with OMLT. To learn more about IDAES, see the [IDAES-PSE Github Page](https://github.com/IDAES/IDAES-PSE) or [IDAES Read-the-docs](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)."

    "This model has 12 outputs of interest, the steam flowrate, the reformer duty, and the properties of the outlet stream, including temperature, pressure, and composition. We are interested modeling how these outputs change as a function of two operating (or input) variables: \n",
    "- the fraction of natural gas that bypasses the reformer\n",
